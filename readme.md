# Sentiment Analysis with ML.NET

This sample assumes 1 as toxic and 0 as Not toxic.

It seems similar sentences must be present in both files data.tsv and test.tsv, so accuracy increasesand can be greater than 90%.

So test.tsv file could have a similar sentence, not exactly the same. For example:

|         | data.tsv                       | test.tsv            |
|---------| ------------------------------ | ------------------- |
|Sentence | `0	This is an awesome movie`  | `0	This is awesome` (optional / wonÂ´t affect results) |

So the results for sentiments below be something like

```
Model quality metrics evaluation
--------------------------------
Accuracy: 100.00%
Auc: 100.00%
F1Score: 100.00%

Sentiment: This is an awesome movie and you should see it. | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.3716927
Sentiment: This is an awesome | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.1004808
Sentiment: This is an awesome movie | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.06005618
```

If you remove sample sentence `0	This is awesome` from test.tsv, accuracy will still be 100% and results are the same:
```
Sentiment: This is an awesome movie and you should see it. | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.3716927
Sentiment: This is an awesome | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.1004808
Sentiment: This is an awesome movie | Prediction: Not Toxic | Probability: 0.06005618
```

But if you forget to add sentence in data.tsv, results might fail
```
Sentiment: This is an awesome movie and you should see it. | Prediction: Toxic | Probability: 0.9042763
Sentiment: This is an awesome | Prediction: Toxic | Probability: 0.6573405
Sentiment: This is an awesome movie | Prediction: Toxic | Probability: 0.7090305
```
Adding too many different sentences in data might cause some toxic sentiments to be evaluated as not toxic and vice versa. Not sure what causes this behavior yet.
